The files in this directory are:
1. O3Scaled.mat
2. DDC_ver01_1_CAMS.m
3. ddc2.m
O3Scaled.mat has the data to analyse the ozone percentage.
DDC_ver01_1_CAMS.m has the function for implementing the data density-based clustering with a manual radii. 
DDC2.m is the Matlab user script used to call the function with radii=0.1257. The outputs of Results (data with cluster number) and Clusters (array of cluster centre co-ordinates and radii) are produced.

Run:
1.	Import O3scaled.mat into the matlab workspace.
2.	Run and time the ddc2.m script.
3.	Make sure you are in the correct folder path.
